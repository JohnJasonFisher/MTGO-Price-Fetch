# fetchWAN

MTG fetch is a Ruby on Rails 4 application that I made during my time at the Actualize 
programming bootcamp. The back end of this application was written in ruby and the front end was written in html, css and javascript.

MTG fetch automates the process of investing with three features.
  -Collection manager
  -Price histories
  -SMS notifications

The collection manager allows the user to see their entire Magic the Gathering card portfolio.
